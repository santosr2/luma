## [0.1.0-rc.1] - 2025-12-23

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **release**: Use no-range git-cliff for first release to capture all commits ([`cdc256c`](https://github.com/santosr2/luma/commit/cdc256c615d1f607e91ef5e12109042d578ed69f)) by [@santosr2](https://github.com/santosr2)
## Problem
    When checking out a tag in detached HEAD, git rev-list finds the wrong
    "first commit". Also, using ranges like first..tag might not work
    correctly in detached HEAD state.

    ## Solution
    For first release, just run git-cliff without any range:
    - `git-cliff --strip all` generates from all reachable commits
    - This works correctly even in detached HEAD state
    - Captures complete project history for first release

    For subsequent releases, use tag range as before.
